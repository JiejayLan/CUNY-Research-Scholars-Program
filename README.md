## research content

* Analyzed how tea leaves can be used to remove pollutants from contaminated water. 
* Used R language to develop mathematical models of the processes involved (e.g. adsorption) and the filter mechanisms we designed. 
* Original research was presented at the 2017 MAA Math Fest Meetings and was published at Kudos journal by Taylor and Francis. (June 2018).

## ABSTRACT
We present noncompetitive adsorption as “particles in a box with one sticky wall.” We start with a general model which can be modeled as a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE). To verify the ODE students run a computer simulation. The ODE’s solution imperfectly fits the simulation’s data. This leads to the diffusion partial differential equation (PDE). We show how to determine the diffusion constant from theory; how to determine how many terms in the Fourier series solution need to be summed; and the use of non-linear regression. As a bonus, the physics of the model will lead us to a series representation of π.
